# Reproducing the Experiment

There are three test cases, each test case can be fully reproduced by running ```python3 main_vdp.py```, ```python3 main_linear.py```, ```python3 main_nonlinear.py```, which first 
generates time series data through simulating the systems with random initial conditions, and then initializes a ResNet model to train on the generated data.
